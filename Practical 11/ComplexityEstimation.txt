The general logical to go through all the posibility is 2 choices and 3 operations.

2 choices:
1. select a number from four
2. select a second from three remained

3 operations:
1. combine two number that are not selected with the first operation
2. combine the first result with the second operation
3. combine the send result with the third operation

The operation above means a set of 6 operation, including +--*//.

The worst situation is that all the choices and operations have to be done.
That means 4*3*6*6*6=2592.
